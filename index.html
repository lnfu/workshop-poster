            <h1>BioArt workshop #1 _The art of SynBio_ Bacteria paintings</h1>
            <p>Join the lab to make your own BioArt with the sparkling <i>E. coli</i> and explore the science
                behind synthetic biology. No biology experience is required apart from curiosity and a
                creative spirit!</p>
            <h2>About this event</h2>
            <p>Synthetic biology is an innovative field of science that involves redesigning organisms for
                specific purposes by engineering them with new abilities. The power of synthetic biology has
                been used to solve many problems in biomedicine, agriculture and manufacturing, and
                beyond. From vaccines to boost immunity, bioreactor to degrade PET, to fabric made from
                spider silk, synthetic biology has been collaborate with humans in a wide range.
                As exciting as the advance of these innovation technologies are, it often seems hard for us to
                engage with scientific world . So, how do we begin to understand synbio that has changed our
                life in many aspect? How do we engage with this cool innovations?</p>
            <h2>In this workshop, you will: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn the basic knowledge and application of synthetic biology</li>
                <li>Consider the ethical implications of technology in synthetic biology</li>
                <li>Make your own art piece by using your choosing <i>E. coli</i> expressing different fluorescent
                    protein</li>
            </ul>
